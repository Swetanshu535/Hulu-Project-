Hulu Project is a project where using the dataset and I have worked on it to create the dashboard 

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest work on a Hulu Dataset Analysis project! ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š

As a data enthusiast, I was tasked with analyzing a dataset containing critical information like show_id, type, title, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, genres (listed_in), price (in dollars), and city. To make sense of this data and present actionable insights, I created a comprehensive and interactive dashboard using Excel.

Here are a few of the key analyses I performed:

Type and Ratings: One of the first insights I explored was understanding the relationship between the type of content (e.g., movies, TV shows) and its rating. By applying slicers, I enabled viewers to filter through different content types and ratings dynamically, making it easier to spot trends across the data.

Listed In and Price Total: Another aspect I analyzed was how different content genres (or listed categories) correlate with price. With the help of Excel functions, I summarized the total price for each category. This information is vital for understanding pricing strategies and value offerings across different content segments.

Show ID and Their Price: To dive deeper into individual shows, I analyzed show_id and their corresponding prices. This detailed analysis helps to identify which specific titles contribute most to revenue, making it easier to assess high-value shows.

City and Title Count: Finally, I analyzed the geographic distribution of Huluâ€™s content across different cities, counting the number of titles available in each city. This insight provides valuable data on the reach and content availability in various locations.

To make the dashboard even more user-friendly and insightful, I incorporated slicers, allowing for dynamic filtering of the data by city, type, and rating. This interactivity empowers stakeholders to explore the data based on their specific interests or business needs without getting overwhelmed by the volume of information.

Overall, this project was an exciting dive into data analysis, helping to uncover key insights from Hulu's dataset. I'm thrilled with the outcome and the practical applications that this dashboard offers. Looking forward to more data adventures ahead! ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
